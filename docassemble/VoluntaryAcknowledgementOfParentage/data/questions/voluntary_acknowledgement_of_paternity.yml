  Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity - VAP
subquestion: |
  Welcome to Illinois Legal Aid Online's **Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity - VAP** Easy Form.

  This program helps you create documents to tell the state who a child's biological father is. The form it creates as called a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity, also called a VAP.
  
   Once legal paternity is shown, the biological father will have all the rights and responsiblities of a legal parent. The father will have the right to have a relationship with the child, but he will also be responsible for supporting the child financially.
  
  The form you create can only be used in Illinois.

subquestion: |
  You can use this program to create documents to tell the state who a child's biological father is.

  Set aside 10 to 20 minutes to finish this program. You can log in and save your work to return to later. 

  After you download your form, you and the other parent will have to sign the VAP in front of witnesses. Then, you will have to file the VAP with the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services (HFS).

question: |
  Requirements
subquestion: |
  To use a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity, you must be a father seeking to acknowledge that you are the parent of a child, or a mother helping the father of your child to acknowledge paternity.
  
  To complete this program, you will need to know:

  * The other parent's address, birth date, and birth place, and
  * The child's name and birthdate.
  
  If the child's mother was married to someone else when the child was conceived or born, you need to know:
  
  * The mother's husband or ex-husband's address, birth date, and birth place, and
  * The date of their marriage. 
  
  Note: this program can only be used if both biological parents agree and can sign the forms. If the parents do not agree, you must ask a court to establish paternity. Learn how to [**start a court case to establish paternity**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/starting-case-parentage-court).
